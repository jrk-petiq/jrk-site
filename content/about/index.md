# About the author

## How It All Started...

My earliest memories of reading were the biographies of pioneers and the childhood classics that were packaged for young children with plenty of pictures. I would read under the covers with a flashlight. When the flashlight ran out of batteries (sometimes it would be months before I could scrounge up more), I would sleep on the floor in the doorway of the room that I shared with my brothers, so that I could read by the light of the hallway. When I heard someone coming, I would hide the book under my pillow and feign sleep. My favorite book was an illustrated version of Call of the Wild by Jack London. I must have read that thing a hundred times before I turned twelve. Still to this day, I fantasize, from time to time, about running away from civilization to the wild... Getting away from it all, but let's face it, the wifi is shit out there.

The stories of early pioneers may have gotten me hooked on reading, but it wasn't until I was a teenager that the writing bug started to nibble at me. I discovered girls and guitars and poetry and songwriting and athletics, but more than that, I found sci-fi and fantasy that I could escape to when the world outside my room didn't seem like the friendliest of places.

Slowly, over the years, I came to realize the power that stories have to touch readers and change their lives, even if it's only to provide a brief respite from the harsher edges of reality. Stories have given my life so much enrichment, and I couldn't be happier to have the chance to give some of that back to the world.

These days, I hail from Boise, ID by way of Nashville, TN. I enjoy family and tacos and jiu-jitsu and the occasional cold beer.

Nothing makes the long days quite so worth it as to hear from a reader who has found enjoyment in the tales I’ve spun, so please do find me on social media or shoot me a quick email. I’d love to hear from you!

Cheers, and thanks for reading!
