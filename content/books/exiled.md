### _The Oculus has been destroyed, but the damage is already done._

Gaia has been overrun by the Terran invasion. Hordes of Gaians are forced into massive internment camps where they are given a nanite treatment that will alter their genetic code and cut them off from the flux forever.

On the run, Celia leads a small band of refugees through the countryside, trying to stay one step ahead of the Terran patrols and keep herself and her people free.

After destroying the Oculus, Kid finds himself back on Gaia with several weeks missing from his memory. When he discovers a brand new ability tied together with powers beyond his control, he could very well be the key to victory against the Terrans. But first, he must learn to harness his raw potential from a mysterious stranger.

With the military and government in shambles, Desmond must organize the resistance and find a way to turn the tide of the invasion and free his people before they are stripped of the very thing which makes them Gaian.

Meanwhile, with each moment that passes, the true villain grows more and more powerful in the shadows, threatening both Gaian and Terran alike. Will Desmond, Celia, and Kid be able to turn back the Terran invasion and stop the emerging menace? Or will they be forced to choose between the people they love and an unspeakable fate?
