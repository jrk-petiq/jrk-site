### _Secret nanotechnology. Humans with incredible powers. One family's secret threatens to shatter the uneasy peace between worlds._

Desmond Bishop is struggling with his recent retirement from the Gaian Defense Agency, when his daughter, Celia, calls him out of the blue.
Multiple kidnappings have taken place overnight in what appears to be a coordinated effort by agents of the Seventh Verse.
For years, Desmond warned the GDA that an attack like this was possible, but they didn't want to listen. Now, he's more than
content to let them clean up their own mess, but a sinister family secret drags him back into the fold.
Together, Desmond and Celia must uncover the truth about the hidden menace that threatens to destroy their entire world and find a way
to stop it before they lose everything they hold dear.
